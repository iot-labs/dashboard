## Introduction to IoT Labs
IoT Labs was created to help IoT device developers who are not familiar with web development environments.
The goal of this project is to help developers realize their IoT ideas.

This project aims to utilize the most common and simple technologies, and emphasizes detailed description of its features. Developers will be able to learn and understand IoT Labs through many of its examples and real-world application case studies.

### Project Goal

The influence of IoT technology is increasing and there have been many attempts to incorporate IoT technology in various fields. Many students and less-experienced developers are trying to create and improve their IoT ideas. But there is a steep learning curve for those who have no background in software engineering.

IoT Labs strives to help those who have great ideas but are not familiar with software engineering by lowering the learning curve of software development.
